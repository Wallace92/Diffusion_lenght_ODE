# Diffusion_lenght_ODE
The Diffusion lenght in semiconductor physic is defined as the lenght at which the concentration of extra carriers (for example injected by electic field pn junction) decreasses e-times (about 63%). In other words at what distance the concentration of extra carriers will be 33% of initial value.
